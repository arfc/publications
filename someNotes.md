* some ideas so far:
** action system that allows large systems of 1D pipe problems to be easily constructed.
** these pipes could be either 3D or 1D. Pressure losses due to bends, etc could be modeled.
** With full-blown chemistry in moltres, some possibly really cool thermochemical transients like
** MgO addition through some external reactor could be modeled.
