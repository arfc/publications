	abstract = {This paper analyzes the impact of the Fukushima accident on the future of nuclear
power around the world. We begin with a discussion of the ‘but for’ baseline and the
much discussed ‘nuclear renaissance.’ Our pre-Fukushima benchmark for growth in
nuclear generation in the U.S. and other developed countries is much more modest than
many bullish forecasts of a big renaissance in new capacity may have suggested. For at
least the next decade in developed countries, it is composed primarily of life extensions
for many existing reactors, modest uprates of existing reactors as their licenses are
extended, and modest levels of new construction. The majority of forecasted new
construction is centered in China, Russia and the former states of the FSU, India and
South Korea. In analyzing the impact of Fukushima, we break the effect down into two
categories: the impact on existing plants, and the impact on the construction of new units.
In both cases, we argue that the accident at Fukushima will contribute to a reduction in
future trends in the expansion of nuclear energy, but at this time these effects appear to be
quite modest at the global level.},

	abstract = {La conception du coeur d’un réacteur nucléaire est fortement multidisciplinaire (neutronique, thermo-hydraulique, thermomécanique du combustible, physique du cycle, etc.). Le problème est aussi de type multi-objectif (plusieurs performances) à grand nombre de dimensions (plusieurs dizaines de paramètres de conception).Les codes de calculs déterministes utilisés traditionnellement pour la caractérisation des coeurs demandant d’importantes ressources informatiques, l’approche de conception classique rend difficile l’exploration et l’optimisation de nouveaux concepts innovants. Afin de pallier ces difficultés, une nouvelle méthodologie a été développée lors de ces travaux de thèse. Ces travaux sont basés sur la mise en oeuvre et la validation de schémas de calculs neutronique et thermo-hydraulique pour disposer d’un outil de caractérisation d’un coeur de réacteur à neutrons rapides à caloporteur sodium tant du point de vue des performances neutroniques que de son comportement en transitoires accidentels.La méthodologie mise en oeuvre s’appuie sur la construction de modèles de substitution (ou métamodèles) aptes à remplacer la chaîne de calcul neutronique et thermo-hydraulique. Des méthodes mathématiques avancées pour la planification d’expériences, la construction et la validation des métamodèles permettent de remplacer cette chaîne de calcul par des modèles de régression au pouvoir de prédiction élevé.La méthode est appliquée à un concept innovant de coeur à Faible coefficient de Vidange sur un très large domaine d’étude, et à son comportement lors de transitoires thermo-hydrauliques non protégés pouvant amener à des situations incidentelles, voire accidentelles. Des analyses globales de sensibilité permettent d’identifier les paramètres de conception influents sur la conception du coeur et son comportement en transitoire. Des optimisations multicritères conduisent à des nouvelles configurations dont les performances sont parfois significativement améliorées. La validation des résultats produits au cours de ces travaux de thèse démontre la pertinence de la méthode au stade de la préconception d’un coeur de réacteur à neutrons rapides refroidi au sodium.},

	abstract = {The International Atomic Energy Agency is giving continuous attention to the collection,
analysis and exchange of information on issues of back-end of the nuclear fuel cycle, an
important part of the nuclear fuel cycle. Reprocessing of spent fuel arising from nuclear
power production is one of the strategies for the back end of the fuel cycle. As a major
fraction of spent fuel is made up of uranium, chemical reprocessing of spent fuel would leave
behind large quantities of separated uranium which is designated as reprocessed uranium
(RepU). Reprocessing of spent fuel could form a crucial part of future fuel cycle
methodologies, which currently aim to separate and recover plutonium and minor actinides.
The use of reprocessed uranium (RepU) and plutonium reduces the overall environmental
impact of the entire fuel cycle. Environmental considerations will be important in determining
the future growth of nuclear energy. It should be emphasized that the recycling of fissile
materials not only reduces the toxicity and volumes of waste from the back end of the fuel
cycle; it also reduces requirements for fresh milling and mill tailings. In comparison, the
method of direct disposal of spent fuel premeditates creation of larger capacity repositories for
permanent disposal. The issue of recycle and reuse of valuable material is important for the
nuclear fuel cycle in the context of sustainable growth of the nuclear energy. Recognizing the
importance of this subject, the International Atomic Energy Agency initiated the preparation
of this report to review and summarize information available on the management of
reprocessed uranium.},

	abstract = {Management of spent fuel from commercial nuclear reactors is a key issue for many NEA
member countries. As interim storage facilities in many countries reach their design capacities,
the need to optimise spent fuel storage management is becoming an increasingly important
issue to managing fuel cycle costs while reducing associated risks. In nuclear criticality safety
studies involving spent fuel, burn-up credit is being pursued and has been implemented in many
countries as a means of more accurately and realistically determining the system reactivity by
taking into account a decrease in the reactivity of spent fuel during irradiation. Implementation
of burn-up credit has gained in world-wide interest during the last 20 years and it represents one
of the most technically challenging issues in nuclear criticality safety. To address these challenges
and help co-ordinate activities in NEA member countries, the Working Party on Nuclear
Criticality Safety (WPNCS) of the OECD/NEA Nuclear Science Committee (NSC) has organised the
Expert Group on Burn-up Credit Criticality (EGBUC). The decision of many countries to advance
burn-up credit as part of their criticality safety licensing strategy has heightened interest in
measurement data needed to validate code calculations for a burn-up credit methodology.},

In general, countries with on-going nuclear scenarios would profit from MA mass stabilization, while transmutation of Pu and MAs from SNF could be desired in countries in nuclear phase-out. Both missions can be accomplished by employing fast reactors loaded with fuels containing different amounts of Pu and MAs in a closed (or partially closed) fuel cycle. In this paper, two 1200 MWth sodium-cooled fast reactor cores, based on the French ASTRID design, are proposed for burning TRUs (phase-out option) or only MAs (on-going option). Main attention is focused on the safety and on the transmutation performance. The coolant void effect, in the region including the core and the plenum above and the Doppler constant of both systems are negative also with irradiated fuel. The conversion ratios (CR) of the Pu and MA burners are in the ranges from 0.6 to 0.7 and from 0.5 to 0.6, respectively. These results show a large safety and transmutation potential of ASTRID type reactors.},

The physics of transmutation allows to point-out preferential approaches, e.g., based on the use of a fast neutron spectrum. The practical implementation of Partitioning and Transmutation implies the development of sophisticated technologies and can be more realistic if seen in a regional context. Some examples will be given to illustrate the “regional” approach, and some considerations will be made on the use of Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS), in the frame of a progressive strategy from present nuclear power fleets to future systems, as studied, e.g., in the frame of the GENERATION-IV initiative.},

	abstract = {In the framework of the ASTRID project at CEA, core design studies are performed at CEA with the AREVA and EDF support. At the stage of the project, pre-conceptual design studies are conducted in accordance with GEN IV reactors criteria, in particularly for safety improvements. An improved safety for a sodium cooled reactor requires revisiting many aspects of the design and is a rather lengthy process in current design approach. Two types of cores are under evaluation, one classical derivated from the SFR V2B and one more challenging called CFV (low void effect core) with a large gain on the sodium void effect. The SFR V2b core have the following specifications : a very low burn-up reactivity swing (due to a small cycle reactivity loss) and a reduced sodium void effect with regard to past designs such as the EFR (around 2\$ minus). Its performances are an average burn-up of 100 GWd/t, and an internal conversion ratio equal to one given a very good behavior of this core during a control rod withdrawal transient). The CFV with its specific design offers a negative sodium void worth while maintaining core performances. In accordance of ASTRID needs for demonstration those cores are 1500 MWth power (600 MWe). This paper will focus on the CFV pre-conceptual design of the core and S/A, and the performances in terms of safety will be evaluated on different transient scenario like ULOF, in order to assess its intrinsic behavior compared to a more classical design like V2B core. The gap in term of margin to a severe accident due to a loss of flow initiator underlines the potential capability of this type of core to enhance prevention of severe accident in accordance to safety demonstration.

	shorttitle = {Politics and {Nuclear} {Power}},
	abstract = {With the dramatic changes OPEC precipitated in the structure of world energy markets during the 1970s, energy became a central concern to policymakers throughout the industrialized West. This book ex-amines the responses of public officials in three leading European nations -- the Federal Republic of Germany, France, and the Netherlands -- to the energy crisis. As the study shows, the proposed energy programs in the three countries shared remarkable similarities; yet the policy outcomes were very different. To explain why, Michael T. Hatch goes beyond the specific content of government energy policy to include an analysis of the policymaking process itself.At the heart of the study is an exploration of the various dimensions of nuclear policy in West Germany. The political consensus on nuclear power that prevailed in the initial years following the energy crisis disintegrated as antinuclear "citizens' initiatives," the courts, and trade unions, as well as the traditional political parties, entered the policymaking process. Subsequent government efforts to resolve the political stalemate over nuclear power foundered in a morass of domestic electoral politics and an international debate over nuclear proliferation.Extending the analysis to comparisons with French and Dutch nuclear strategies, Hatch argues that the critical factor in determining nuclear policy was the manner in which the political system structured the nuclear debate. In contrast to West Germany, where the electoral and parliamentary systems enhanced the influence of the antinuclear "Greens," the electoral system and constellation of political parties in France served to dissipate the influence of the antinuclear forces. Thus in France the nuclear program en-countered few impediments. In the Netherlands, as in West Germany, government policy was paralyzed in the face of antinuclear sentiment across a broad spectrum of Dutch society.Hatch has provided here not only a useful examination of the development of energy policy in western Europe but also a case study of the close interplay between policy and politics.},

Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

As with all simulation tools, fuel cycle simulators require verification through unit tests, benchmark cases, and integral tests. Model validation is a vital aspect, as well. Although comparative studies have been performed, there is no comprehensive unit test and benchmark library for fuel cycle simulator tools. The objective of this paper is to identify some of the “must test” functionalities of a fuel cycle simulator tool within the context of specific problems of interest to the Fuel Cycle Options Campaign within the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy (DOE-NE). This paper identifies the features needed to cover the range of promising fuel cycle options identified in the DOE-NE Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening and categorizes these features to facilitate prioritization. Features are categorized as essential functions, integrating features, and exemplary capabilities. A library of unit tests applicable to each of the essential functions should be developed as future work. An international dialog on the functionalities and standard test methods for fuel cycle simulator tools is encouraged.},

	abstract = {The symbiotic equilibrium between 1.51 GWe breeder SFR (Sodium Fast Reactors) and 1.6 GWe EPR™ (European Pressurized water Reactors) is studied. EPR™ are only supplied with MOX (Mixed OXide) fuel to avoid the use of natural uranium. The equilibrium is studied by considering the flows of plutonium. Its isotopic composition is here described by a single real number referred to as the Pu grade. Plutonium flows through both reactor types are characterized by using linear functions of the Pu grade in new fuels. These functions have been determined by fitting data from a former scenario study carried out with the COSI6 simulation software.
Two different reprocessing strategies are considered. With joint reprocessing of all spent fuels, total and fissile plutonium flows balance for a unique fraction x of EPR™ in the fleet, equal to 0.2547. This x value is consistent with the results reported in the former scenario study mentioned above. When EPR™ spent fuels are used in priority to supply SFR (distinct reprocessing), x reaches 0.2582 at most. COSI6 simulations have been performed to further assess these results. The EPR™ fraction in the fleet at symbiotic equilibrium barely depends on the applied reprocessing strategy, so that the more flexible joint reprocessing constitutes the reference option in that case.},
