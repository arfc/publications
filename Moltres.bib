	abstract = {The molten salt reactor ({MSR}), which is one of the ‘Generation {IV}’ concepts, can be used for transmutation, and production of electricity, hydrogen and fissile fuels. In this study, a single-liquid-fueled {MSR} is designed for conceptual research, in which no solid material is present in the core as moderator, except for the external reflector. The fuel salt flow makes the {MSR} neutronics different from that of conventional reactors using solid fuels, and couples the flow and heat transfer strongly. Therefore, it is necessary to study the core characteristics with due attention to the coupling among flow, heat transfer and neutronics. The standard turbulent model is adopted to establish the flow and heat transfer model, while the diffusion theory is used for the neutronics model, which consists of two-group neutron diffusion equations for fast and thermal neutron fluxes, and balance equations for six groups of delayed neutron precursors. These two models which are coupled through the temperature and heat source are coded in a microcomputer program. The distributions of the velocity, temperature, neutron fluxes, and delayed neutron precursors under the rated condition are obtained. In addition, the effects of the inflow temperature, inflow velocity, and the fuel salt residence time out of the core are discussed in detail. The results provide some valuable information for the research and design of the new generation molten salt reactors.},

Their possibilities of usage as a coolant, heat transfer fluid or heat storage substrate, require thermo-hydrodynamic refined calculations. Many researchers are using simulation techniques, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for their projects or conceptual designs. The aim of this work is providing a review of basic properties (density, viscosity, thermal conductivity and heat capacity) of the most common and referred salt mixtures. After checking data, tabulated and graphical outputs are given in order to offer the most suitable available values to be used as input parameters for other calculations or simulations. The reviewed values show a general scattering in characterization, mainly in thermal properties. This disagreement suggests that, in several cases, new studies must be started (and even new measurement techniques should be developed) to obtain accurate values.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a multi-physics modelling (MPM) approach developed for the study of the dynamics of the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), which has been reconsidered as one of the future nuclear power plants in the framework of the Generation IV International Forum for its several potentialities. The proposed multi-physics modelling is aimed at the description of the coupling between heat transfer, fluid dynamics and neutronics characteristics in a typical MSR core channel, taking into account the spatial effects of the most relevant physical quantities. In particular, as far as molten salt thermo-hydrodynamics is concerned, Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations are used with the turbulence treatment according to the RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier{\textendash}Stokes) scheme, while the heat transfer is taken into account through the energy balance equations for the fuel salt and the graphite. As far as neutronics is concerned, the two-group diffusion theory is adopted, where the group constants (computed by means of the neutron transport code NEWT of SCALE 5.1) are included into the model in order to describe the neutron flux and the delayed neutron precursor distributions, the system time constants, and the temperature feedback effects of both graphite and fuel salt. The developed MPM approach is implemented in the unified simulation environment offered by COMSOL Multiphysics{\textregistered}, and is applied to study the behaviour of the system in steady-state conditions and under several transients (i.e., reactivity insertion due to control rod movements, fuel mass flow rate variations due to the change of the pump working conditions, presence of periodic perturbations), pointing out some advantages offered with respect to the conventional approaches employed in literature for the MSRs.},

	abstract = {A molten salt reactor (MSR) is a class of generation IV nuclear fission reactor in which the primary nuclear reactor coolant, or even the fuel itself, is a molten salt mixture. MSRs can run at higher temperatures than water-cooled reactors for a higher thermodynamic efficiency, while staying at low vapour pressure.
The nuclear fuel may be solid or dissolved in the coolant. In many designs the nuclear fuel dissolved in the coolant is uranium tetrafluoride (UF4). The fluid becomes critical in a graphite core that serves as the moderator. Some solid-fuel designs propose ceramic fuel dispersed in a graphite matrix, with the molten salt providing low pressure, high temperature cooling. The salts are much more efficient than compressed helium (another potential coolant in Generation IV reactor designs) at removing heat from the core, reducing the need for pumping and piping and reducing the core size.
The concept was established in the 1950s. The early Aircraft Reactor Experiment (1954) was primarily motivated by the small size that the design could provide, while the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (1965{\textendash}1969) was a prototype for a thorium fuel cycle breeder reactor nuclear power plant. The increased research into Generation IV reactor designs included a renewed interest in the technology.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the development, validation, and results of a three-dimensional, time- dependent, coupled-neutronics{\textendash}thermal-hydraulic calculational scheme for channel-type molten salt re- actors (MSRs). The reactor physics part is based on diffusion theory, extended by a term representing the flow of the fuel through the core. The calculation of the temperature field is done by modeling all fuel channels, which are coupled to each other by a three-dimensional heat conduction equation. For the purpose of validation, the results of the MSR Experiment (MSRE) natural-circulation experiment and the thermal feedback coefficients of the reactor have been calculated and compared.
With the aid of a code system developed to implement this scheme, calculations were carried out for the normal operating state of the MSRE and some debris-induced channel-blocking-incident transients. In the case of the MSRE, it is shown that the severity of such an incident strongly depends on the degree of channel blocking and that high-temperature gradients in the moderator can connect thermally the adjacent fuel channels. Results are included for an unblocking transient (i.e., the debris suddenly exits the core, and the fuel flow reverts to the normal operating pattern), and it was demonstrated that during the unblocking large power peaks can be induced.},

	abstract = {FLiBe is a molten salt made from a mixture of lithium fluoride (LiF) and beryllium fluoride (BeF2). It is both a nuclear reactor coolant and solvent for fertile or fissile material. It served both purposes in the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE).
The 2:1 mixture forms a stoichiometric compound, Li2BeF4, which has a melting point of 459 {\textdegree}C, a boiling point of 1430 {\textdegree}C, and a density of 1.94 g/cm3. Its volumetric heat capacity is 4540 kJ/m3K, which is similar to that of water, more than four times that of sodium, and more than 200 times that of helium at typical reactor conditions. Its appearance is white to transparent, with crystalline grains in a solid state, morphing into a completely clear liquid upon melting. However, soluble fluorides such as UF4 and NiF2, can dramatically change the color salt in both solid and liquid state. This made spectrophotometry a viable analysis tool, and it was employed extensively during the MSRE Operations
The eutectic mixture is slightly greater than 50\% BeF2 and has a melting point of 360 {\textdegree}C. This mixture was never used in practice due to the overwhelming increase in viscosity caused by the BeF2 addition in the eutectic mixture. BeF2, which behaves as a glass, is only fluid in salt mixtures containing enough molar percent of Lewis base. Lewis bases, such as the alkali fluorides, will donate fluoride ions to the beryllium, breaking the glassy bonds which increase viscosity. In FLiBe, beryllium fluoride is able to sequester two fluoride ions from two lithium fluorides in a liquid state, converting it into the tetrafluorberyllate ion BeF4-2.},

FHRs have the capacity to deliver heat at high average temperature, and thus to achieve higher thermal efficiency than light water reactors. Licensing of the passive safety systems used in FHRs can use the same framework applied successfully to passive advanced light water reactors, and earlier work by the NGNP and PBMR projects provide an appropriate framework to guide the design of safety-relevant FHR systems. This paper provides a historical review of the development of FHR technology, describes ongoing development efforts, and presents design and licensing strategies for FHRs. A companion review article describes the phenomenology, methods and experimental program in support of FHR.},

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) were conceived at the early stages of nuclear energy in view of the favourable features fostered by a liquid fuel. They were developed as graphite-moderated thorium-fuelled breeder reactors till the seventies, when studies on this reactor concept were mostly abandoned in favour of the liquid{\textendash}metal fast breeder concepts. A decade ago, the MSRs were included among the six GEN-IV systems and a core optimization process allowing for the GEN-IV main objectives led toward a fast-spectrum MSR concept (MSFR {\textendash} Molten Salt Fast Reactor). Albeit advantageous in terms of U-233 breeding and/or radio-active waste burning, the new concept lacks the notable know-how available for the thermal-spectrum MSR technology. The present paper preliminarily investigates the MSR dynamics, based on the conceptual MSFR design currently available. A primary objective is to benchmark two different models of the MSFR primary circuit, both of them including a detailed and fully-coupled (node-wise) representation of turbulent fuel-salt flow, neutron diffusion, and delayed-neutron precursor diffusion and convection. A good agreement is generally observed between the adopted models, though some discrepancies exist in the temperature-field, with ensuing mild impacts on the reactor dynamics. The performed analyses are also used for a preliminary characterization of the MSFR steady-state and accidental transient response. Some points of enhancement needed in the MSFR conceptual design are identified, mainly related to in-core velocity and temperature fields. The reactor response following major accidental transient initiators suggests a generally benign behaviour of this reactor concept.},

	abstract = {The family of Generation-IV reactor concepts comprises of multiple promising designs, one of which is the molten salt reactor. These reactors have traditionally been chosen for the possible use of the thorium-uranium fuel cycle and used 7LiF-BeF2 carrier salt. This particular salt choice however presents several challenges due to the cost of highly depleted 7Li isotope for the carrier salt, tritium production, and beryllium toxicity. Additionally, lack of developed and accepted safeguards methodology for thorium fuel cycle presents a barrier. While none of these issues are insurmountable, alternatives are worth investigating. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the more cost effective and regulatory amenable fuel salt choices by using low-enriched uranium fuel in the form of UF4. Several eutectic mixtures are examined that avoid the use of 7Li and Be while maintaining a melting point low enough to be compatible with standard structural materials. The optimal conditions for hexagonal lattice arrangements using nuclear graphite moderation are discussed for multiple fuel salt choices. The aim of this study is to present options of using simpler molten salt reactor alternatives focused on thermal single-fluid low-enriched uranium converter concepts.},

Historically, simulation of an entire reactor was accomplished by linking together multiple existing codes that each simulated a subset of the relevant multiphysics phenomena. Recent advances in the MOOSE (Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment) framework have enabled a new approach: multiple domain-specific applications, all built on the same software framework, are efficiently linked to create a cohesive application. This is accomplished with a flexible coupling capability that allows for a variety of different data exchanges to occur simultaneously on high performance parallel computational hardware. Examples based on the KAIST-3A benchmark core, as well as a simplified Westinghouse AP-1000 configuration, demonstrate the power of this new framework for tackling{\textemdash}in a coupled, multiscale manner{\textemdash}crucial reactor phenomena such as CRUD-induced power shift and fuel shuffle.},

The MAC calculates thermal-hydraulic parameters, namely temperature distribution, flow distribution and pressure drop. The MCNP4c performs the analysis of effective multiplication factor, neutron flux, power distribution and conversion ratio. In this work, the modification of core configuration is achieved by different core zoning and various fuel channel diameters, contributing to flat flux distribution. Specifically, the core is divided into two regions and the effects of different core zoning on the both neutronics and thermal-hydraulic behavior of moderated molten salt reactor are investigated.

	abstract = {In the framework of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF-IV), six innovative concepts of nuclear reactors have been proposed as suitable to guarantee a safe, sustainable and proliferation resistant source of nuclear energy. Among these reactors, a peculiar role is played by the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), which is the only one with a liquid and circulating fuel. This feature leads to a complex and highly coupled behaviour, which requires careful investigations, as a consequence of some unusual features like the drift of Delayed Neutron Precursors (DNP) along the primary circuit and heat transfer with a heat-generating fluid. The inherently coupled dynamics of the MSRs asks for innovative approaches to perform reliable transient analyses. The node-wise implicitly-coupled solution of the Partial Differential Equations (PDE) that govern the different phenomena in a reactor would offer in this sense an ideal solution. However, such an approach (hereinafter referred to as Multi-Physics {\textendash} MP) requires a huge amount of computational power. In this work, we propose and assess a Geometric Multiscale approach on MSR, addressing the core modelling with a 3-D MP approach and the remaining part of the system {\textendash} e.g., the cooling loop {\textendash} with simplified 0-D models based on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). The aim is to conjugate the accuracy of the MP modelling approach with acceptable computation loads. Reference is made to the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE), due to the availability of a detailed design and experimental data that are used for assessment and preliminary validation of the developed simulation tool.},

A physically meaningful weight can be assumed as the solution of the adjoint model, which is constructed for the situation considered, including delayed neutrons.

The graphite-moderated channel type MSR {\textendash} one of the {\textquoteleft}Generation IV{\textquoteright} concepts {\textendash} was selected for the numerical simulation. It has several peculiarities (e.g. the drift of delayed neutrons precursors), which disable the use of standard dynamics codes. Therefore, the own DYN3D-MSR code was developed. It is based on the light water reactor code DYN3D and it allows transients simulation by 3D neutronics and parallel channel thermal-hydraulics. The neutronics and thermal-hydraulics were modified for the MSR peculiarities, where the experience from DYN1D-MSR development was exploited. The code was validated on experimental results from the MSRE experiment done in Oak Ridge National Laboratory and by the comparison with other codes especially with the 1D version. However, by the 3D code transients can be simulated, where space-dependant efforts are relevant, like local blockage of fuel channels or local temperature perturbations.},

	abstract = {In the paper, the development of a multiphysics model for the transient analysis of non-moderated Molten Salt Reactors is discussed. Particular attention is devoted to the description of the adopted time integration and physics coupling strategies. The proposed model features the adoption of an implicit Runge{\textendash}Kutta scheme and the coupling among neutron diffusion, Reynolds-Averaged Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations for mass and momentum conservation, and energy and delayed neutron precursor balance equations, in order to accurately catch thermal feedbacks on neutronics. The solver is aimed at performing fast-running simulations of the full-core three-dimensional Molten Salt Fast Reactor geometry. The neutronics modelling is assessed against Monte Carlo simulations and the results of a simplified case study are compared to those from multiphysics tools previously developed. As an example of the capability of the model, an unprotected MSFR single pump failure accidental scenario is simulated and discussed. The main purpose of the present model is to serve as fast-running computational tool in the phase of design optimization of fuel loop components. More in general, it is of valuable help in the study of reactor physics of circulating-fuel systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The present relates to the integration of the primary functional elements of graphite moderator and reactor vessel and/or primary heat exchangers and/or control rods into an integral molten salt nuclear reactor (IMSR). Once the design life of the IMSR is reached, for example, in the range of 3 to 10 years, it is disconnected, removed and replaced as a unit. The spent IMSR functions as the medium or long term storage of the radioactive graphite and/or heat exchangers and/or control rods and/or fuel salt contained in the vessel of the IMSR. The present also relates to a nuclear reactor that has a buffer salt surrounding the nuclear vessel. During normal operation of the nuclear reactor, the nuclear reactor operates at a temperature that is lower than the melting point of the buffer salt and the buffer salt acts as a thermal insulator. Upon loss of external cooling, the temperature of the nuclear reactor increases and melts the buffer salt, which can then transfer heat from the nuclear core to a cooled containment vessel.},

This generation IV reactor is characterized by a liquid fuel circulating in the core cavity, requiring specific simulation tools. An innovative neutronic approach called {\textquotedblleft}Transient Fission Matrix{\textquotedblright} is used to perform spatial kinetic calculations with a reduced computational cost through a pre-calculation of the Monte Carlo spatial and temporal response of the system. Coupled to this neutronic approach, the Computational Fluid Dynamics code OpenFOAM is used to model the complex flow pattern in the core. An accurate interpolation model developed to take into account the thermal hydraulics feedback on the neutronics including reactivity and neutron flux variation is presented. Finally different transient studies of the reactor in normal and accidental operating conditions are detailed such as reactivity insertion and load following capacities. The results of these studies illustrate the excellent behavior of the MSFR during such transients.},
